# WebM2MP4Bot

A Telegram inline bot that downloads WebM files from link,
converts them to MP4 and sends to the chat.

## Development

Run `make` or read the provided `Makefile`.

## Running

The bot depends on `ffmpeg` and will only work if you have it on your machine.
Copy the `env.example` file, set your settings and save it as `.env`.
Now you are good to go and the bot will hook your settings up.
